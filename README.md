# RSA_RK
    Implemented Rabin-Karp string matcher for Text search with alphabet {a-z, A-Z, 0-9}.     
    Implemented RSA-Encryption with 32-bit Primes for encoding consisting of a 19-digit number , 
    composed from 16-digit Credit card number + 3-digit CVV.  
    The implementation of  both of the algorithms have been done in Python.
